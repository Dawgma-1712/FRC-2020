So to get an auto routine onto the robot, first make sure you can ssh the robot by going into git bash and typing: ssh lvuser@10.17.12.2
if that gives you in error about someone trying to hack you or something like that then go type: cd C:/Users/competition/.ssh
then type rm -rf known_hosts
then you should be fine
After that copy and paste the cd command below into git bash
then copy and paste the scp command into git bash
That should do the trick
remember to use the Auto routines command for auto routines and the path files command for path files
Also remember to replace FILENAME.txt with the name of the path or auto file you want

FOR AUTO ROUTINES

cd 'C:/Users/competition/Documents/LabVIEW Data/Projects/FRC-2020/Auto Editor/AutoFileEditor/AutoFiles'
scp FILENAME.txt lvuser@10.17.12.2:/home/lvuser/Auto/AutoFiles


FOR PATH FILES

cd 'C:/Users/competition/Documents/LabVIEW Data/Projects/FRC-2020/Auto Editor/PathDrawer/Paths'
scp FILENAME.txt lvuser@10.17.12.2:/home/lvuser/Auto/PurePursuit
